# Java Utility Functions

This repository contains utility functions implemented in Java, focusing on commonly used operations in **string manipulation** and **numeric problem solving**. The repository consists of two main classes: `Solution` and `NumProb`.

## Classes Overview

### Solution Class

The `StringProblems` class is dedicated to string manipulation functions, including:
- Reversing a string.
- Checking if a string is a palindrome.
- Concatenating two strings.
- Additional useful operations related to string handling.

### NumProb Class

The `NumProb` class provides solutions to a variety of numeric problems, such as:
- Generating the Fibonacci series.
- Calculating factorials.
- Checking for prime numbers and palindrome numbers.
- Calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM).
- Converting numbers between binary, decimal, and octal formats.
- Finding the area of geometric shapes.
- Sorting arrays with bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.
